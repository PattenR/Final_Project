Supervisor: Professor Peter Flach

All auxiliary material for this project can be found at the repository for the project:

https://github.com/PattenR/Final_Project

The repository contains 7 different branches, the ones containing up to date code are:

-mnist_single
--Contains code for the pairwise distribution classifier for MNIST with a single input.

-MNIST_branch
--Contains code for the pairwise distribution classifier for MNIST with a size 16 input.

-CNN_branch
--Contains code for the pairwise distribution classifier for CIFAR10 with a size 16 input.
--See the cifar10 folder for the altered CNN mentioned in section 5.1. 

For experiments into the Gaussian mixture see the master branch, commit 07e4405688819d3bdb84419f0ec288cf7132a5fd

The main file of interest is property_analysis_code/main.py

All the code used in any of the experiments can be found in this repository.
